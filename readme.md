This test project uses Laravel7x to build a middleware API system that communicates with SMS GLobal's APIs to send and receive messages

# API Endpoints

## API Docs
/api/docs

## POST Message
POST /api/v1/message

## Get List of Messages
GET /api/v1/message

# Notes
- Due to shortage of time there is less formatting and documentation done. Similarly, for the same reason I only did basic checks and didnt do all the checks I would do otherwise.
- TODO: Paginated fetch and Paginated output for messages list method
- TODO: More checks for empty returns and errors
- TODO: improve documentation
